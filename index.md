## Biography
I am a Phd. student in department of Computer Science and Technology, [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an_Jiaotong_University), advised by [Prof. Jinsong Han](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BST50KwAAAAJ&hl=en). Formerly I spent five and half years for B.E. and M.E in this campus on Computer Science, advised by [Prof. Yinliang Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=o-DXXd4AAAAJ&hl=en).  Currently I am a visiting student of Human Sensing Lab and DeLight Lab, The Robostics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Dr. Dong Huang](https://www.donghuang-research.com/).  
My research interest is building novel sensory systems for human sensing.
